# PTRAC_POS2CSV
These instructions should be followed to plot the SDEF source point created by MCNP and exported by means of the PTRACT fuction (based on MCNP5.1.6 release).
This routine only converts the PTRAC file into a csv file which can be later loaded in Paraview.

## How to use the routine
    > python PTRAC_POS2CSV.py -i PTRAC_filename -o CSV_outputfilename

## Complete instructions
1) Run MCNP with the following instruction or similar
    
        > PTRAC NPS=1,1e7 TYPE=P WRITE=pos FILE=asc EVENT=src MAX=1e5
    
2) Run the Python3.6 PTRAC_POS2CSV.py routine.
   
        > PTRAC_POS2CSV.py -i PTRAC_filename -o CSV_outputfilename
 
3) Load the csv text file in Paraview.
 
4) Use the filter "Table to Point" selecting the right variables for X, Y and Z. 
Remember to tick the "Mantain all variable" to be able to visualize also the ""scalar" field.
    
5) Plot the "Table to Point" in a 3D render

6) Enjoy ... =)
